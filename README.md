This is a source code of the Liinback self-host program and service. It's not longer called "Liinback API".
Liinback is a service and self-host program that is another revival of the YouTube application for the Nintendo Wii that has more features working.
The features that are working for right now is the sign in, uploader's profile icon display in a video player screen, pairing, and the video player features.
Liinback mostly uses InnerTube more than Invidious for more features. Invidious though is for the user's uploads section when they sign into their YouTube account and for the uploader's profile icon display.
Your playlists will not appear in your "My YouTube" menu, but instead in the main menu on where it includes your YouTube profile categories/types of YouTube videos such as gaming, sports, trendings, and other categories.

The only format that Liinback supports for videos to display and load on the Nintendo Wii is a (.webm) video format in only VP8. The good news is that the program could load videos faster and display in any sizes.
The maximum quality though is 360p. But the bad news is that it's also not perfect, which the YouTube application on the Wii can fail to load videos by either crashing your Wii, playing a video that is corrupted, or the channel displays:
"An unknown error has occurred. Please try again later." So please do not say that or accuse me that I quote on quote, "didn't warn you", thank you very much. If you don't like that and if you really want to watch YouTube
on your Nintendo Wii in another method without having to deal with this kind of mess anymore, you could go ahead and search on https://www.google.com, "RiiTube".

I hope you enjoy this release of Liinback that I made and thank you for using it. Y'all can use this to make public instances of Liinback. Be careful now, because somebody or Google could take action with your instances or my
project here I made.
